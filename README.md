# C++ Calculator

### Hello guys! I am V39Pygamer. You must have tried my Space Invaders Game. If you haven't tried it click [here](https://github.com/V39Pygamer/Space-Invaders-Game). As I am new to Github and I am showing you what all programming languages I know. To show you that I know C++, I have made this repositorie which is a basic calculator made with C++. I had made this when I was learning the language but found Python more insteresting and started to learn Python. I am still working on my second game in Python and will mostly release by next week.

### Before you try this calculator make sure you have C++ and an editor installed. 

# ENJOY!
